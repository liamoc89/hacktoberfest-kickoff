# Opencast's Hacktoberfest Kickoff Hackathon

This session is intended to help you get started contributing to open source software!

If you're new to git or GitHub, we'll start by walking through how to create a Pull Request to add yourself to the [register](./REGISTER.md).

If you have experience with GitHub, you can skip ahead to the [projects](./PROJECTS.md).
